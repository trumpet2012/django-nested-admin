Documentation
=============

django-nested-admin is a project that makes it possible to nest
admin inlines (that is, to define inlines on InlineModelAdmin classes). It
also allows these inlines to be sorted by drag-and-drop, and has optional
Grappelli support.

Compatibility
=============

django-nested-admin is compatible with Django 3.2+ and Python versions 3.8+.
It is also compatible with django-grappelli. It does not require Grappelli
for drag-and-drop sorting features.
